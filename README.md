# TraceQ
Sanger trace viewer made with PyQt5. This application supports .ab1 file format as input.
TraceQ is specifically designed to quantify base mismatch rate at any position of the trace file. 
TraceQ allows for the analysis of several samples in parallel


# Statement of Need


# Key features

- Supports .ab1 file format
- Visualize individual Sanger Traces
- Quantify the heights of overlapping peaks to identify mismatch rate at any position
- Analyze mismatch rate across samples for comparison
- Control sequence quality across samples to ensure dataset reliability
- Export subset of sanger traces in svg format for quick embedding into scientific articles
